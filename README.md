# Prompts

This page is dedicated to play a guessing game between the user and my site. 

The user will be alerted with several prompts asking questions about me(Adriana).

The first question will ask if the user is ready to play a question game, the options are y/n. I have also attached a rule so that regardless of the capitilization of the answer entered by the user, the computer will read it lower case. I included if and else statements. If the user answers y, the answer is correct and prompts "Great!", anything else the prompt is "Too bad!"

The five following questions are;

Q1 Do I like true crime?
Q2 Are my sneezes obnoxious?
Q3 Do I hate watching movies and tv?
Q4 Do I prefer Iron Man to Captain America?
Q5 Am I a dog person?

Correct Answers are;
Q1CA - Y (Prompt) Correct!
Q1IA - N (Prompt) You're wrong!

Q2CA - Y (Prompt) I'm very sorry, I wish I could make them quiet..
Q2IA - N (Prompt) You angel, stop lying..

Q3CA - N (Prompt) HA! Nope!
Q3IA - Y (Prompt) I could watch movies and tv everyday for the rest of my life.
